UK senior doctors' career destinations, job satisfaction, and future intentions: questionnaire survey


null
We mailed questionnaires in 1998, asking about employment history and current job. In all, 77% (1717/2217) replied (72% (1223) of men and 80% (494) of women). Of respondents, 97% (1673) were in medical employment in the United Kingdom or abroad, and 85% (1460) worked in the UK NHS. The table shows the distribution of their specialties. In NHS general practice, 98% (488) of men and 85% (183) of women were principals; of these, 39% (72) of women and 5% (25) of men worked part time. In NHS hospital practice, 97% (469/485) of men and 76% (114/150) of women whose main paid post was in the NHS (not in a university) were consultants; of these, 26% (30) of women and 11% (50) of men worked part time.  Table | Profile of 1673 respondents (graduates from 1974) in medical employment in 1998: specialty and job satisfaction. Values are numbers (percentages of all medical posts) unless stated otherwise We asked respondents to score five statements about job satisfaction, from "strongly agree" (score 1) to "strongly disagree" (5). The statements were "I find enjoyment in my current post"; "I am doing interesting and challenging work"; "I feel dissatisfied in my current post"; "most days I am enthusiastic about my work"; "I am often bored with my work"). We calculated a job satisfaction score by totalling the scores for all five statements: 20 or more represented a positive response, on average, to all statements, and we suggest that this shows a high level of satisfaction. Respondents rated their job satisfaction reasonably highly (table), with some significant but small differences between occupational groups. Hospital doctors were more satisfied with their jobs than general practitioners; women general practitioners were more satisfied than men (group median scores 19.7 and 18.8 respectively); and part time general practitioners were more satisfied than those working full time (19.8 and 18.9) (all P<0.001). This last finding was mainly explained by the comparatively lower job satisfaction of male general practitioners working full time. Respondents practising medicine in the United Kingdom were asked whether they intended to continue doing so for at least another five years. Most respondents definitely intended to do so; more NHS hospital doctors than general practitioners were definite (85.8% (580/676) and 77.9% (553/710); P<0.001). Reasons cited for considering leaving UK medicine included dissatisfaction or disillusionment with their job or with the NHS; ill health; stress or pressure associated with the job; and a desire for change, travel, other interests, or to work in a developing country.
The results provide benchmark findings on the career destinations of doctors who qualified in the 1970s, with which career profiles of more recent generations can be compared. Only a quarter of the 1974 graduates were women. Women from the 1974 cohort were less likely than men to hold consultant or principal posts, and few women were surgeons. Many more women than men worked part time. In the future NHS, many more of the senior posts will be filled by women because more women than men now enter medical school, reversing the former situation in which men substantially outnumbered women. As the government recognises, doctors' working lives need to be balanced with their expectations about raising a family and other interests. Replies about short term intentions portray a workforce committed to working in the NHS, with stable careers over the next few years. Levels of job satisfaction were generally high. Nevertheless, many respondents commented that they were working close to the limits of what they regarded as a reasonable commitment of their time, and many do not intend to work to the age of 65.
