Inositol Phospholipid Metabolism in Arabidopsis. Characterized and Putative Isoforms of Inositol Phospholipid Kinase and Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C
Phosphoinositides (PIs) constitute a minor fraction of total cellular lipids in all eukaryotic cells. They fulfill many important functions through interaction with a wide range of cellular proteins. Members of distinct inositol lipid kinase families catalyze the synthesis of these phospholipids from phosphatidylinositol. The hydrolysis of PIs involves phosphatases and isoforms of PI-specific phospholipase C. Although our knowledge of the roles played by plant PIs is clearly limited at present, there is no doubt that they are involved in many physiological processes during plant growth and development. In this review, we concentrate on inositol lipid-metabolizing enzymes from the model plant Arabidopsis for which biochemical characterization data are available, namely the inositol lipid kinases and PI-specific phospholipase Cs. The biochemical properties and structure of characterized and genome-predicted isoforms are presented and compared with those of the animal enzymes to show that the plant enzymes have some features clearly unique to this kingdom.

Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is a major phospholipid in eukaryotic cells. Three of the five free hydroxyl groups of PtdIns can be phosphorylated in cells in different combinations. In total, seven phosphorylated derivatives of PtdIns have been detected, one of which, PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3], has not been found in plant cells . These inositol phospholipids are collectively referred to as phosphoinositides (PIs). In animal cells, PIs and their derivatives operate in signal transduction pathways triggered by stimuli as diverse as growth factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and light .  Figure 1 | PI metabolism. PI metabolism. The different steps in the synthesis of PIs and the lipid kinases catalyzing the different reactions are indicated. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is present in animal cells but has not been detected in plant tissues, so far. In animal cells, PtdIns(3,4)P2 can be generated from PtdIns4P by a PtdIns 3-kinase or by an as-yet-unidentified PIPkin from PtdIns3P. Plant cells do not contain any homolog of the heterodimeric inositol lipid 3-kinases that are able to phosphorylate PtdIns4P to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be synthesized by type I and type II PIPkins from PtdIns4P and PtdIns5P, respectively. On the basis of sequence comparison, plants cells do not possess type II PIPkins. PtdIns5P is present in plants, but an enzyme capable of producing it has not been identified. Historically, the first major insight into the importance of PIs was the discovery that the two PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2]-derived second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and diacylglycerol promote Ca2+ release from internal stores and activate protein kinase C, respectively (; for review, see ). The production of these two second messengers from PtdIns(4,5)P2 is catalyzed by PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) isoforms. During the last decade, it has become evident that in addition to serving as precursors to Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol, PIs actively participate in several other cellular processes. They have been shown to regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton through interaction with actin-binding proteins , and to potentiate the activation of protein kinase C , PI-PLC , and phospholipase D . In addition, PIs phosphorylated at the D3-hydroxy group of the inositol head group are required for specific vesicle trafficking steps  and are able to activate the protein kinase Akt/PKB and PI-dependent kinases . A 3-phosphorylated PI, PtdIns 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2], was recently identified and shown to accumulate in yeast cells subjected to hyperosmotic or NaCl stress . In addition, mutations in many of the proteins involved in the PI system cause various diseases or severe defects . The PIs clearly constitute a group of lipids with very important, diverse functions. It is therefore critical that the levels of these phospholipids are tightly regulated. The lipid kinases catalyzing the synthesis of the phosphorylated derivatives of PtdIns, and isoforms of PI-PLC have been extensively studied and characterized; some of them have also been crystallized and their structure determined. In comparison with the wealth of information available for the components, regulation, and function of the animal PI system, and despite the identification of plant homologs of many of these animal components, our knowledge of the plant PI system is, at present, quite limited. However, it has been demonstrated that micro-injected "caged" Ins(1,4,5)P3 can release Ca2+ from internal stores  and is also able to trigger stomatal closure . There is also evidence that PIs may participate in the regulation of cytoskeletal structures in plant cells  and in polar pollen tube growth . A number of reports also suggest that a wide range of signals, such as light, hormones, and stress, may mediate their effect through PI-dependent processes , although the effects reported were often limited and the identity of the lipid or inositol phosphate species affected not always clearly demonstrated. More recently, hyperosmotic stress was shown to induce an increase in two distinct PtdIns bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) isomers, PtdIns(4,5)P2 in Arabidopsis cells  and PtdIns(3,5)P2 in Chlamydomonas moewusii and in some higher plant cells . It is also now clear that, as in other organisms, vesicle trafficking in plant cells is dependent on PIs . A PtdIns 3-kinase was recently found associated with nuclear transcriptionally active sites, suggesting a potential role for this lipid kinase in the regulation of transcription in the nucleus . It is also interesting that chloroplasts contain both PtdIns 3- and 4-kinase activities . Additional evidence that a functional PI system operates in plant cells has been provided by the identification of homologs of the components of the animal PI system, such as PI-metabolizing enzymes , PI-regulated enzymes , and PIs themselves . Of the seven phosphorylated derivatives of PtdIns identified in animal systems, only PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has never been observed in plant cells (or in yeast). The presence of PtdIns5P in higher plants has only recently been unambiguously demonstrated . Previous reviews on the metabolism and function of PIs in plant cells have provided overviews of some aspects of this field but were published before the availability of a complete plant genome sequence and lack a thorough description of some of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of these lipids . The aim of the present review is to provide a detailed summary of the information available on the enzymes involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of PIs, i.e. the PI kinases and PI-PLCs. It includes a description of the structure, and of the molecular and biochemical properties of these enzymes, with new information gleaned from sequence comparison and analysis. When possible, in vivo functions are also discussed.
As shown in Figure , PtdIns can be phosphorylated on three of the five free hydroxyl groups of the inositol ring in reactions catalyzed by PtdIns kinases. The enzymes catalyzing the phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 4 have been identified and characterized. There is an animal enzyme capable of generating PtdIns5P from PtdIns in vitro ; however, whether this enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of PtdIns5P in vivo is not known. PtdIns 3-Kinase | Multiple PtdIns 3-kinase isoforms have been identified. On the basis of their structure and substrate specificity, they can be divided into three classes . All PtdIns 3-kinases share three conserved domains: a catalytic domain preceded by a helical domain and a C2 domain (a Ca2+-dependent or -independent lipid-binding domain originally identified in protein kinase C; ; Fig. ). Class I PtdIns 3-kinases are heterodimeric enzymes that can phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro, but preferentially phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vivo. These PtdIns 3-kinases are subdivided into class IA and class IB. The catalytic subunit of class IA enzymes associates with one of three different adaptor proteins, whereas the class IB catalytic subunit (only one has been identified) associates with a p101 adaptor protein. Class II PtdIns 3-kinases preferentially use PtdIns and PtdIns4P as substrates. Class I and II PtdIns 3-kinases possess a ras-binding domain at their N terminus, and class II enzymes are characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain  and a second C2 domain at their carboxy terminus (see Fig. ). Finally, class III PtdIns 3-kinases include the only PtdIns 3-kinase identified in Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), ScVps34p, and all of its orthologs from other organisms. Class III PtdIns 3-kinases phosphorylate only PtdIns and are believed to represent the ancestral form of PtdIns 3-kinase. The Vps34 protein exists as a complex with a Ser/Thr protein kinase both in Brewer's yeast  and animals . This protein kinase, encoded by the VPS15 gene in Brewer's yeast, phosphorylates and activates Vps34. A putative ortholog of this protein kinase is also present in Arabidopsis (At4g29380), suggesting that some of the processes regulating protein trafficking may be conserved in animals, yeast, and plants.  Figure 2 | Domain structure representation of PtdIns 3-kinases. Domain structure representation of PtdIns 3-kinases. A, The domains conserved in the catalytic subunits of the three PtdIns 3-kinase classes are represented by colored boxes. B, Vps34 proteins from Brewer's yeast (Vps34p; accession no. ), Arabidopsis (AtVps34; accession no. ), and human (HsVps34; accession no. ) were aligned using the ClustalW program from the MacVector package. Identical, conserved, and semiconserved residues are indicated below the alignment by *, :, and ., respectively. // indicates a large gap in the sequence. The only PtdIns 3-kinase identified so far in Arabidopsis, AtVps34, is a homolog of ScVps34p. The VPS34 gene was identified in a screen for Brewer's yeast mutants altered in the sorting of vacuolar proteins , and was shown to encode a PtdIns kinase that phosphorylates PtdIns exclusively at the D-3 position of the inositol ring . Although the substrate specificity of AtVps34 has not been fully determined, it is reasonable to assume that like ScVps34p, it can only phosphorylate PtdIns, not PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2. In both Brewer's yeast and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), the VPS34 gene is not essential but is necessary for normal growth . Point mutations in the catalytic domain of Vps34p or deletion of the VPS34 gene lead to dramatic decreases in cellular levels of PtdIns 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) in Brewer's yeast and severe defects in vacuolar protein sorting . Down-regulation of the expression of the AtVPS34 gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in severe inhibition of growth and development , indicating that AtVps34 is required for normal plant development. The Arabidopsis AtVPS34 cDNA was unable to complement a VPS34 yeast deletion mutant. However, a chimeric gene consisting of Brewer's yeast VPS34 in which the region coding for the catalytic domain had been replaced by the corresponding region of the Arabidopsis gene could complement the yeast mutant. This also suggests that regions other than the catalytic domain are required for the function of Vps34p in vivo, and that the regulation mechanisms of Vps34 enzymes differ between species. A distinctive feature of Vps34 proteins versus other PtdIns 3-kinases is the presence of a longer insert between the amino-terminal C2 domain and the helical domains, and of an extended insert (approximately 60 amino acid residues) in the helical domain. The latter insert is not present in AtVps34 (Fig. B). The two most commonly used PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors are wortmannin (a fungal metabolite) and LY294002 (a synthetic molecule; ). In vitro, their IC50 values are around 5 nm for wortmannin and 1 mum for LY294002 . Surprisingly, ScVps34p is much less sensitive to these compounds (IC50 of 3 mum for wortmannin and 50 mum for LY294002; ), whereas the human Vps34 ortholog exhibits sensitivities similar to those of the most sensitive PtdIns 3-kinases. In addition, wortmannin inhibits other enzymes including PtdIns 4-kinases (e.g. ; ) and PtdIns phosphate (PtdInsP) kinases (PIPkins; ), but with IC50 values 20- to 1,000-fold higher than for PtdIns 3-kinase inhibition. Fifty micromolar LY294002 does not inhibit a range of animal protein kinases . However other enzymes, such as the PtdIns 3-kinase-related protein kinases TOR and DNA-dependent protein kinase, and to a lesser extent casein kinase-2, are sensitive to LY294002 . Casein kinase-2 is not inhibited by wortmannin . One major problem with using wortmannin is that it is rather unstable in solution, and incubation times longer than a couple of hours should be avoided . In summary, in animal systems, wortmannin and LY294002 are, at low concentrations (up to 1 mum for wortmannin and up to 50 mum for LY294002), specific inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase; but at higher concentrations, they lose specificity. Wortmannin has been shown to inhibit PtdIns 3-kinase activity in crude tobacco extracts, with calculated IC50 values of 98 nm in vitro and approximately 1 mum in vivo . In this plant system, wortmannin also inhibited the sorting of one type of protein to the vacuole, with an IC50 of approximately 7 mum, a value close to the IC50 of 9 mum for the synthesis of all phospholipids examined, except PtdIns3P . The effects of wortmannin on vacuolar sorting in these studies are difficult to interpret in terms of the involvement of PIs and/or other phospholipids because extremely high concentrations of wortmannin and long incubation times were used, and the specificity of wortmannin has not been tested with plant enzymes. Before using wortmannin and LY294002 to assess the possible involvement of PtdIns3P in physiological processes in plant systems, it must first be established that they specifically inhibit PtdIns 3-kinase and do not significantly affect other enzymes in the same concentration range. Wortmannin was demonstrated to covalently bind to a Lys residue in the ATP-binding site of a class I PtdIns 3-kinase, inducing a conformational change in the catalytic domain of the enzyme . This Lys residue is conserved in all PtdIns 3-kinases. The difference in sensitivity to wortmannin of the different PtdIns 3-kinases is believed to be attributable to differences in amino acid residues surrounding the conserved Lys residue in the ATP-binding site of these isoforms. However, it remains unknown which residues determine wortmannin sensitivity. As the sole PtdIns 3-kinase present in Arabidopsis, AtVps34 is probably responsible for the synthesis of the majority of the PtdIns3P found in plants. Class I and II PtdIns 3-kinases are activated by G-protein-coupled receptors and Tyr kinase receptors, which are represented by a large number of distinct members in animal cells. Plants, on the other hand, possess few putative G-protein-coupled receptors and no receptor Tyr kinases. It is therefore not surprising that class I and II PtdIns 3-kinases are absent from plants.  recently showed that the homolog of AtVps34 is associated with active transcription sites in soybean (Glycine max) cell nucleoli. As in yeast, the product of Vps34 activity, PtdIns3P, participates in the trafficking of proteins to the plant vacuole . In that study, Kim et al. also demonstrated that PtdIns3P is present in several compartments, including the Golgi apparatus and vacuole networks. PtdIns3P-dependent trafficking involves proteins with a FYVE domain (named after four proteins that it has been found in: Fab1, YOTB/ZK632.12, Vac1, and EEA1; ), a domain that confers highly specific binding to PtdIns3P . In Arabidopsis, more than 10 proteins contain a FYVE domain (see the SMART database: ), only one of which has been characterized . The Brewer's yeast genome encodes fewer than 10 FYVE domain-containing proteins; the human genome encodes more than 50. Two of the plant FYVE proteins probably represent putative homologs of the PtdIns3P 5-kinase protein Fab1p from Brewer's yeast. Several PX domains, including all of the PX domains present in Brewer's yeast, have been shown to bind PtdIns3P . Arabidopsis contains up to nine putative proteins with a PX domain. Fifteen have been identified in Brewer's yeast, whereas humans have more than 50 (SMART database). This indicates that the functions of PtdIns 3-kinases are much more diverse in animals than in plants and yeast.  PtdIns 4-Kinases | Biochemical Characterization | PtdIns 4-kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of PtdIns to PtdIns4P [a lipid believed to be the major precursor of PtdIns(4,5)P2], and therefore represents a potentially crucial point in the regulation of the PI-dependent pathways. Two major types of PtdIns 4-kinase, II and III, differing in size and sensitivity to detergents and adenosine, have been identified in a wide range of tissues and cellular compartments in animals . Type II PtdIns 4-kinase is a membrane-bound, 55-kD enzyme that is readily renaturable after SDS-PAGE. It has comparatively low Km values for PtdIns and ATP, is strongly inhibited by adenosine and Ca2+ , and is insensitive to wortmannin . Two forms of type III PtdIns 4-kinase have been detected in membrane and soluble fractions of animal tissues. One is 110 kD in size, and the other is 200 to 230 kD. Type III enzymes have 3- to 7-fold higher Km values for PtdIns and ATP than the type II enzyme and are not inhibited by adenosine and Ca2+. In addition, type III enzymes are inhibited by wortmannin (at concentrations significantly higher than those inhibiting PtdIns 3-kinases), whereas type II enzymes are insensitive . PtdIns 4-kinase activity is present in many different compartments in plant cells, and has been partially purified from the soluble fraction of the unicellular alga Dunaliella parva  and from carrot (Daucus carota) cells . It has also been found in plasma membranes from Catharanthus roseus  and spinach (Spinacia oleracea; ). The size of the partially purified plant PtdIns 4-kinases was estimated to be 80 kD for the soluble activity from carrot cells, 500 kD for the activities purified from D. parva and C. roseus, and 65 and 125 kD for the two distinct activities purified from spinach plasma membranes. A soluble 49-kD protein, PIK-A49, was able to stimulate a PtdIns 4-kinase activity solubilized from carrot plasma membranes . PIK-A49 was shown to bind and bundle actin and was identified as an elongation factor 1 . Stimulation of PtdIns 4-kinase was dependent on the phosphorylation status of PIK-A49 . Using antibodies raised against a recombinant PtdIns 4-kinase,  were able to immunoaffinity purify an active PtdIns 4-kinase from Arabidopsis microsomes. Wortmannin was recently shown to inhibit the two PtdIns 4-kinase activities partially purified from spinach plasma membranes .  Genes, Structure, and Function | cDNAs encoding functional PtdIns 4-kinases have been isolated from animals, Brewer's yeast, and Arabidopsis, using either peptide sequences from purified proteins or homologous cloning using previously available sequences. Genes encoding type III enzymes have been grouped into two distinct subfamilies, alpha and beta, based on sequence and structure similarities . Subfamily beta is represented by proteins of 68 to 122 kD, and subfamily alpha by proteins of 200 to 230 kD (with the exception of human PI4Kalpha, which is a 97-kD protein ). Several domains are conserved in these proteins, including a catalytic domain of about 230 amino acid residues within the C-terminal part of these proteins, and a helical domain (previously referred to as PIKa or LKU domain), the location of which varies among the different isoforms . Members of the alpha subfamily all contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that separates the helical and catalytic domains in these proteins. Another conserved domain, novel homology (NH) is conserved in all of the isoforms belonging to the beta subfamily (Fig. ; ). NH domains were first identified in yeast Pik1p and in a soluble PtdIns 4-kinase from rat .  Figure 3 | Domain structure representation of animal, yeast, and plant PtdIns 4-kinases. Domain structure representation of animal, yeast, and plant PtdIns 4-kinases. The various conserved domains are represented by colored boxes. The catalytic domains of type II and III PtdIns 4-kinase share no homology and are therefore shown in different colors. Some plant type II PtdIns 4-kinases contain one or two ubiquitin-like domains. Although PtdIns 4-kinase activity was first detected, characterized, and partially purified from higher plants many years ago, the isolation and functional expression of a full-length plant PtdIns 4-kinase cDNA was first reported in 1999 . The corresponding 126-kD protein from Arabidopsis, AtPI4Kbeta1 (previously AtPI4Kbeta), is similar in size and overall primary structure to the PtdIns 4-kinase beta isoforms from yeast and animals. Another cDNA from Arabidopsis, AtPI4Kalpha1 (previously AtPI4Kalpha), encoding a PtdIns 4-kinase has been described . The deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to this partial cDNA comprised a helical, a PH, and a catalytic domain . The gene corresponding to this partial cDNA has now been identified and deposited in the GenBank/EMBL databases . The predicted protein is 227 kD in size and structurally similar to the alpha-isoforms from animal and yeast . No peptide sequences for any of the partially purified plant PtdIns 4-kinases are available, making it impossible to verify whether any of them correspond to one of the Arabidopsis PtdIns 4-kinase genes. The subcellular localization of these two Arabidopsis type III PtdIns 4-kinases is at present not known, but AtPI4Kalpha1 was shown to be present in a microsomal fraction and an actin-enriched fraction .  Table I | List of characterized and predicted PtdIns 4-kinases from Arabidopsis AtPI4Kbeta1 possesses the two conserved domains present in all type III PtdIns 4-kinases, namely the helical and catalytic domains, but lacks a PH domain, features typical of PtdIns 4-kinase alpha isoforms. A conserved domain previously only identified in the yeast PIK1 protein and a rat soluble PtdIns 4-kinase  is also conserved in AtPI4Kbeta1 (domain NH in Fig. ). Surprisingly, AtPI4Kbeta1 is the only known PtdIns 4-kinase to possess a unique repetitive motif constituted of 11 repeats of a charged core unit . No function has yet been assigned to the conserved helical, NH, and repetitive motif domains. Because PtdIns 4-kinase activities have been detected in most cellular compartments, it is possible that the domains identified in PtdIns 4-kinases are involved in the targeting of these enzymes to various cellular compartments through interactions with other proteins or lipids. The PH domain of the carrot homolog of AtPI4Kalpha1 was shown, using a lipid-protein overlay, to bind PtdIns4P but not PtdIns in vitro . It, thus, appears likely that the PH domain of type alpha PtdIns 4-kinases is not responsible for binding the lipid substrate. It is consequently possible that substrate binding in PtdIns 4-kinases is controlled by the helical domain, or a domain conserved structurally but not at the sequence level. As recently observed with other PtdIns 4-kinases, AtPI4Kbeta1 is inhibited by wortmannin at concentrations similar to those affecting the yeast and mammalian enzymes  ---concentrations that are significantly higher than those required to inhibit PtdIns 3-kinases. The residue corresponding to the Lys residue of PI3Kalpha at which wortmannin binds covalently is conserved in AtPI4Kbeta1 as it is in all other type III PtdIns 4-kinases, including AtPI4Kalpha1. Two PtdIns 4-kinase genes, PIK1 and STT4, are present in the genome of Brewer's yeast, both of which are essential for yeast viability . The PtdIns 4-kinases corresponding to these two genes are responsible for the synthesis of distinct pools of PtdIns4P . Using temperature-conditional mutants, the authors demonstrated that Pik1p is essential for normal secretion, Golgi and vacuole membrane dynamics, and endocytosis, and that Stt4p is required for maintenance of vacuole morphology, cell wall integrity, and actin cytoskeleton organization. Intriguingly, Arabidopsis is, so far, the only organism found to possess two genes encoding type IIIbeta PtdIns 4-kinases . The two corresponding protein sequences share 80% identity, and AtPI4Kbeta2 also possesses the NH domain and the repetitive motif. The genome of Arabidopsis contains large segments of duplicated DNA that can be grouped into 103 blocks . The two AtPI4Kbeta genes do not belong to any of the duplicated blocks present in the genome, but they may have occurred from a duplication event not identified by . Arabidopsis also contains a gene encoding a putative protein, AtPI4Kalpha2, with significant similarity to AtPI4Kalpha1 . However, this putative protein is much smaller than AtPI4Kalpha1 and consists of a catalytic domain and a region corresponding to the 114 first amino acid residues of AtPI4Kalpha1. AtPI4Kalpha2 does not contain any other domain, i.e. the PH and helical domains are lacking. No expressed sequence tag (EST) corresponding to this gene is present in the databases, suggesting that it may not be expressed. The conservation of the structure of PtdIns 4-kinases in the different phyla contrasts markedly with the current data available for PI-PLC. On the basis of protein structure and biochemical properties, all plant PI-PLC isoforms appear to belong to a single family closely related to the delta-type of mammalian PI-PLCs, but lacking a PH domain. The identification of genes encoding type II PtdIns 4-kinases was achieved only recently . The corresponding proteins from rat and human form a novel class of PtdIns 4-kinases that is unrelated to previously identified inositol lipid kinases . Potential homologs of these animal type II PtdIns 4-kinases are present in yeast, fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), and Arabidopsis. Surprisingly perhaps, there is only one gene in Brewer's yeast, but search of databases with the entire sequence of human PI4K IIalpha  identified eight putative genes (AtPI4Kgamma1 --8) in Arabidopsis . The predicted Arabidopsis proteins show low overall identity with human PI4K IIalpha, but such is also the case for the putative type II PtdIns 4-kinase from Brewer's yeast (28% identical and 10% similar residues). However,  identified several candidate kinase motifs in type II PtdIns 4-kinases in more than 10 different putative type II PtdIns 4-kinases. Alignment of the Arabidopsis protein sequences with human PI4K IIalpha and the sequence from Brewer's yeast clearly shows that the kinase motifs identified in the animal proteins, which correspond to residues found in subdomains I, II, VIb, VII of protein kinases , are also present in the Arabidopsis sequences (Fig. A). Although, as noted by , there is no close similarity between type II PtdIns 4-kinases and other PtdIns kinases, a number of residues conserved in the candidate catalytic domain of type II PtdIns 4-kinases are also conserved in other PtdIns kinases and/or PIPkins. The GXXG motif of the candidate subdomain I is found in PIPkins , including all Arabidopsis PIPkins, except AtPIPK11 (see Fig. ). The FK motif of the candidate subdomain II, the DRH motif of the candidate subdomain VIb of the Arabidopsis sequences, and the DXG motif of the candidate subdomain VII are all present in PtdIns 3-kinases and PtdIns 4-kinases . These observations strongly suggest that the Arabidopsis putative type II PtdIns 4-kinases may well be functional homologs of the animal enzymes. However, none of the Arabidopsis genes have yet been shown to encode functional PtdIns 4-kinases. Most of the Arabidopsis putative type II PtdIns 4-kinases are significantly larger than the animal enzymes: Six of them are 61 kD or greater in size , instead of 55 kD for the animal enzymes. This is because of the presence of an N-terminal extension in the plant enzymes. Sequence analysis reveals that six of the putative plant type II PtdIns 4-kinases contain one or two ubiquitin domains (Fig. B). No ubiquitin domain is present in non-plant type II PtdIns 4-kinases.

The synthesis of the three PtdInsP2 isomers from PtdInsP isomers is catalyzed by PIPkins (see Fig. ). These enzymes form a family of lipid kinases distinct from PtdIns 3-kinases and PtdIns 4-kinases, and are classified into three subfamilies (type I --III; Table ), depending on their substrate specificity . Type I enzymes are PtdIns4P 5-kinase, and type II enzymes are PtdIns5P 4-kinase . In vitro, type I PIPkins can make PtdIns5P from PtdIns, and PtdIns(3,5)P2 from PtdIns3P , and type II PIPkins can synthesize PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4)P2] from PtdIns3P . In yeast, Mss4p is the only type I PIPkin identified and no type II members appear to be present. Last, type III enzymes are PtdIns3P 5-kinases and are represented by the Brewer's yeast FAB1 gene product and its homologs from other species . In vitro, type III PIPkins can make PtdIns5P from PtdIns .  Table II | List of characterized and predicted PIPkins from Arabidopsis All three PtdInsP2 isomers are present in plant cells, but their relative abundance varies depending on cell type and/or growth conditions , suggesting that the lipid kinases involved in the synthesis of these lipids and/or the transcription of genes encoding these enzymes are tightly regulated. A plant enzyme capable of phosphorylating PtdIns4P to a PtdInsP2 isomer has long been known to be present in the plasma membrane , and both PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 can be generated from endogenous PIs when plant plasma membranes are incubated with ATP (S.K. Dove and B.K. Drobak, personal communication). In animal cells, PtdIns(3,4)P2 synthesis can proceed via two distinct pathways, involving either 3-phosphorylation of PtdIns4P by heterodimeric inositol lipid kinases or a new PIPkin capable of phosphorylating PtdIns3P on the 4-OH group . As mentioned previously, the only PtdIns 3-kinase present in plants is a homolog of the yeast Vps34p protein, which only phosphorylates PtdIns. This suggests that a distinct enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in plant cells. The first gene encoding a functional plant PIPkin was recently identified  and characterized in more detail . When expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, AtPIP5K1 was able to phosphorylate both PtdIns3P and PtdIns4P to generate PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively . When expressed in insect cells, the enzyme was shown to preferentially stimulate the synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and, surprisingly, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 but not PtdIns(3,4)P2 via 5-phosphorylation of endogenous precursors . It is difficult to explain the discrepancy in the lipids generated by the same enzyme in the two heterologous
