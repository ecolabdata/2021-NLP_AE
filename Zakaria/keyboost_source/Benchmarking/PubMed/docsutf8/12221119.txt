Modulation of Cellular Cholesterol Transport and Homeostasis by Rab11
To analyze the contribution of vesicular trafficking pathways in cellular cholesterol transport we examined the effects of selected endosomal Rab proteins on cholesterol distribution by filipin staining. Transient overexpression of Rab11 resulted in prominent accumulation of free cholesterol in Rab11-positive organelles that sequestered transferrin receptors and internalized transferrin. Sphingolipids were selectively redistributed as pyrene-sphingomyelin and sulfatide cosequestered with Rab11-positive endosomes, whereas globotriaosyl ceramide and GM2 ganglioside did not. Rab11 overexpression did not perturb the transport of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine-perchlorate --labeled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to late endosomes or the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1)-induced late endosomal cholesterol clearance in NPC patient cells. However, Rab11 overexpression inhibited cellular cholesterol esterification in an LDL-independent manner. This effect could be overcome by introducing cholesterol to the plasma membrane by using cyclodextrin as a carrier. These results suggest that in Rab11-overexpressing cells, deposition of cholesterol in recycling endosomes results in its impaired esterification, presumably due to defective recycling of cholesterol to the plasma membrane. The findings point to the importance of the recycling endosomes in regulating cholesterol and sphingolipid trafficking and cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

Cholesterol is an essential constituent of membranes in mammalian cells and a precursor for steroid hormone and bile acid synthesis. Cellular cholesterol levels are tightly regulated at the level of synthesis, esterification, and exchange with plasma lipoproteins . The route of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol uptake is hitherto the best characterized cellular cholesterol-trafficking pathway. The role of the LDL receptor in LDL internalization, the breakdown of the lipoprotein particle in acidic organelles, and the homeostatic mechanisms regulating the LDL-receptor levels have been unraveled . However, the contribution of other endocytic routes on cholesterol transport and balance and their interplay with the LDL-receptor route are so far poorly understood at the molecular level. The endocytic organelles have been mainly defined based on the flow of different cargo molecules to early, recycling, and late compartments. Internalized molecules are initially transported to early endosomes (also termed sorting endosomes) from where they can be delivered to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation or become recycled to the plasma membrane either directly or via a recycling endosomal membrane system . Recycling endosomes are considered to be cholesterol enriched . The cholesterol content of the early or late endocytic membranes has not been determined, but late endocytic circuits are considered to be important for the regulation of the cellular free cholesterol content. This is highlighted in the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. In this disease, cholesterol as well as other lipids and proteins accumulate in late endocytic organelles due to mutations in either of two recently cloned gene products, NPC1 or NPC2/HE1 . Consequently, cholesterol homeostatic responses in the endoplasmic reticulum fail, as manifested by defective cholesterol esterification and inappropriately high cholesterol synthesis . NPC1 is a polytopic membrane protein of late endocytic membranes, whereas NPC2 is a cholesterol-binding soluble protein that is also targeted to the late endocytic organelles. The precise functions and trafficking itineraries of both NPC1 and NPC2 remain to be elucidated. We have recently reported that the clearance of lysosomal cholesterol deposits can be inhibited by Rab-GDP dissociation inhibitor . This protein controls multiple vesicular transport pathways by sequestering GDP-bound (inactive) forms of the small GTPases of the Rab family in the cytoplasm. Rab proteins and their effectors coordinate consecutive stages of membrane transport, such as vesicle formation, movement, and tethering of vesicles to their target compartment . To gain further insight into the Rab-dependent endosomal cholesterol-trafficking mechanisms, we screened the potential contribution of selected endosomal Rab proteins 1) morphologically by using filipin staining and 2) biochemically by measuring cholesterol esterification. Based on the results obtained, our further analyses focused on the role of Rab11 in controlling endocytic cholesterol routing. We provide evidence that Rab11-dependent membrane trafficking modulates endosomal cholesterol levels independent of LDL uptake and serves as an important regulator of cellular cholesterol balance.

Alternatively, to deplete cholesterol the cells were incubated with medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS), prepared as in  for 24 h before labeling. To analyze esterification in the presence of LDL, cells grown in culture medium were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and labeled with [3H]oleic acid (5 muCi/ml) in serum-free, 2% defatted BSA medium supplemented with 50 mug/ml LDL for 4 h. After labeling, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS on ice and scraped into PBS, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 2% NaCl.

Aliquots of the cell lysate (20 mug of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37C, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4C with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies . The membrane was then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies (, Hercules, CA). The staining was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences).  Immunocytochemistry | The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized either with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min and blocked with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37C, or alternatively the blocking solution was supplemented with 0.05% filipin to permeabilize the cells. The primary antibodies were diluted in 5% FBS and incubated for 1 h at 37C or overnight at 4C and the secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37C. For filipin staining only, the fixed and quenched cells were incubated with 0.05% filipin in PBS for 15 min and washed with PBS.

Labeling with Pyr10SM | To prepare the Pyr10SM/gamma-CD-complex the lipid was dried under argon and desiccated in the vacuum for 30 min. gamma-CD (100 mM in PBS) was added on the lipid film in a molar ratio of 1000:1, and the suspension was sonicated 3 x 2 min . Cells were labeled with Pyr10SM/gamma-CD-complex at 10 nmol/ml concentration of the lipid for 10 min at 37C and incubated in culture medium for 2 h at 37C before fixation. The fluorescence was excited at 345 nm and visualized at 480/80 nm. The degradation rate of Pyr10SM in COS-1 cells was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using on-line fluorescence detection .

Labeling with DiI-LDL | Cells were incubated in medium containing 5% LPDS for 24 h then labeled with 10 mug/ml DiI-LDL in serum-free medium for 15 min at 37C. After washing with PBS, the cells were either fixed or further incubated in serum-free medium for 2 h at 37C before fixation.  Cholesterol Biosynthesis | Cells on six-well plates were transfected and at 6 h posttranfection the culture medium was changed to medium supplemented with 5% LPDS and [14C]cholesterol (100 nCi/ml) for 41 h. The cells were washed with PBS, pulse labeled with [3H]acetic acid (250 muCi/ml) in serum-free medium for 15 min at 37C, and chased in serum-free medium supplemented with 10 muM lovastatin and 25 mM mevalonate for 90 min at 37C. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS on ice, scraped into PBS, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 2% NaCl. Aliquots were removed for determining the protein concentration. Lipids were extracted as described above, separated by thin layer chromatography, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously .

Redistribution of Free Cholesterol and Inhibition of Cholesterol Esterification upon Overexpression of Endosomal Rab Proteins | COS-1 cells were transiently transfected for 40 --48 h with GFP-fusions of Rab proteins reported to regulate early, late, or recycling endocytic transport events, represented by Rab5, 7, and 11, respectively. Rab5 promotes homotypic fusion of early endosomes . Overexpression of the late endosomal Rab7, on the other hand, has been shown to affect early-to-late endosomal transport and lysosome biogenesis , whereas Rab11 regulates the function of the recycling endosomes . Rab6 that is involved in retrograde trafficking in the Golgi , and soluble GFP were used as controls. To visualize the distribution of free cholesterol, the cells were fixed and stained with the fluorescent sterol-binding antibiotic filipin. In COS cells, the perinuclear area of the cell is strongly filipin positive. In addition, the plasma membrane and punctate peripheral structures are stained, albeit at lower intensity . The prominent perinuclear filipin staining colocalizes with a Golgi marker lentil lectin but several filipin-positive punctae also colocalize with lysosomal or early endosomal markers as visualized by antibodies against lysosomal membrane protein lamp1, or labeling with peptide 2xFYVE that binds the early endosomal phosphatidylinositol-(3)-phosphate (PI-3-P) . The perinuclear aspect of endogenous Rab11 staining also partially overlaps with that of filipin. However, the small peripheral Rab11-positive dots are not resolved by filipin staining. The filipin staining pattern characteristic of untransfected cells was also seen in cells expressing soluble GFP, Rab6, or Rab7 . In Rab5-overexpressing cells, numerous brightly filipin-positive peripheral dots were observed. These structures were also positive for Rab5, indicating that they represent early endosomes . The most pronounced redistribution of filipin staining was seen in Rab11-overexpressing cells. In these cells, intensely filipin stained and Rab11-positive tubular elements extending to the cell periphery were observed . For Rab5, the effects of the GTPase-deficient mutant (Rab5Q79L) are significantly more pronounced than that of the wild-type protein, resulting in massive enlargement of early endosomes . Considering the moderate effect of wtRab5 on filipin staining pattern we also analyzed the effect of Rab5Q79L. In cells expressing this protein, early endosomes became heavily enlarged and their membranes were intensely filipin positive .  Figure 1 | Distribution of free cholesterol in COS-1 cells.

Right, filipin stainings of the respective cells. The arrowheads indicate free cholesterol redistributed in GFP-Rab --positive organelles. Images were obtained using wide-field microscope. Bar 8, mum. To test whether overexpression of the Rab proteins was accompanied by biochemical effects on cholesterol homeostasis, we analyzed cholesterol esterification by measuring the incorporation of [3H]oleic acid into cholesteryl esters at 40 --48 h posttransfection. The values obtained with Rab overexpressions were compared with those obtained with overexpressed GFP alone. Strikingly, overexpression of the Rabs with the most pronounced effects on filipin distribution, Rab5Q79L and Rab11, also caused the strongest inhibition in cholesterol esterification (similar50% inhibition with both; Figure A). Overexpression of Rab7 was slightly inhibitory (25 --30% inhibition), whereas Rab6 overexpression was without effect. The expression levels of the individual Rabs were closely similar with the 50 --70% transfection frequencies obtained, as assessed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies (Figure B). The effects of the individual Rabs on cholesterol esterification could be observed already at 24 h posttransfection (our unpublished data). Furthermore, the Rab11-induced redistribution of cholesterol was morphologically apparent already at 8 h posttransfection, at a stage when the GFP-Rab11 decorated small punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm (Figure A). By 16 h of transfection, the Rab11- and filipin-positive organelles had attained a more tubular appearance and by 24 h, larger vesicular and tubular profiles containing both Rab11 and cholesterol were generated (Figure A).  Figure 3 | Rate of cholesterol esterification in COS-1 cells overexpressing soluble GFP, GFP-fused Rab5Q79L, wtRab6, wtRab7, and wtRab11.

The rate of esterification is shown as percentage of esterification in cells transfected with GFP alone.

Images in B and C are confocal and represent a single focal plane. Bar, 8 mum.  Rab11-positive Organelles Accumulate Transferrin Receptor and Internalized Transferrin | In baby hamster kidney and Chinese hamster ovary cells, Rab11 localizes with internalized transferrin in the pericentriolar recycling compartment  and in HeLa cells, Rab11 overexpression leads to morphological alterations of the TfR-containing compartments . We therefore analyzed the effect of Rab11 overexpression on the distribution of TfR and its ligand in COS cells. Cells were cotransfected with wtRab11 and TfR cDNAs, and at 40 h posttransfection Texas Red transferrin was bound to the cells for 30 min on ice, followed by 30-min internalization at 37C. In control cells expressing soluble GFP and TfR, the receptor was localized in the perinuclear region and in small punctate and tubular structures throughout the cell (Figure B). In Rab11-expressing cells, the TfR staining was concentrated in larger tubular structures that also contained Rab11 (Figure B). Moreover, labeled transferrin accumulated readily in these structures (Figure C). These results suggest that also in COS cells, Rab11 regulates the dynamics of the endosomal recycling compartment as probed by using TfR and its ligand as markers.  Both GTPase-deficient and Dominant Negative Mutants of Rab11 Alter TfR Distribution, Cholesterol Distribution, and Cholesterol Esterification | The GTPase-deficient Rab11 mutant (Rab11Q70L) and the dominant negative mutant (Rab11S25N) differentially affect TfR distribution in HeLa cells . To further characterize the effect of Rab11 on endocytic recycling in COS cells, we studied the distribution of Texas Red transferrin in cells coexpressing TfR and mutant Rab11 proteins. To analyze whether cholesterol distribution was affected, the transfected cells were also stained with filipin. In Rab11Q70L cells, Texas Red transferrin and filipin colocalized in extended tubulovesicular structures that were also strongly positive for the mutant Rab11 . These structures were reminiscent of those observed upon overexpression of wtRab11. Rab11S25N gave a predominantly cytosolic staining pattern in accordance with previous results . In these cells, thinner transferrin-positive tubular elements forming a perinuclearly concentrated network were visualized. This meshwork was also visualized with filipin . We then measured [3H]oleic acid incorporation into cholesteryl esters upon expression of the GTPase-deficient or dominant negative Rab11 mutants. This revealed that both Rab11Q70L and Rab11S25N markedly inhibited cholesterol esterification. The extent of inhibition by either mutant did not differ significantly from that observed with wtRab11 (our unpublished data).  Figure 5 | Effect of GFP-Rab11Q70L and GFP-Rab11S25N on the distribution of Texas Red transferrin and free cholesterol in COS-1 cells.

Right, filipin stainings of the respective cells. The arrowheads indicate redistribution of free cholesterol in tubular organelles. Images were obtained using wide-field microscope. Bar, 8 mum.  Localization of Other Lipids Enriched in Plasma Membrane and Endosomal Compartments in Rab11-overexpressing Cells | Given the Rab11-induced redistribution of cholesterol, we next analyzed whether Rab11 would also affect the subcellular localization of other endosomal lipids. Rab11-expressing cells were labeled with the PI-3-P binding peptide 2xFYVE . We found that the distribution of PI-3-P, typically in small vesicular structures characteristic of early endosomes, was not altered in Rab11-expressing cells and did not overlap with that of Rab11 . We then analyzed the distribution of the late endosomal acidic phospholipid LBPA by antibody staining. Also this staining was similar in Rab11-expressing cells compared with nonexpressing cells and did not colocalize with Rab11 .  Figure 6 | Localization of PI-3-P, LBPA, globotriaosyl ceramide, and GM2 ganglioside is not altered in GFP-wtRab11 --expressing COS-1 cells. Localization of PI-3-P, LBPA, globotriaosyl ceramide, and GM2 ganglioside is not altered in GFP-wtRab11 --expressing COS-1 cells. Cells overexpressing GFP-wtRab11 (left) were permeabilized with filipin and stained with biotin-2xFYVE and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin, anti-LBPA, anti-globotriaosyl ceramide, or anti-GM2 antibodies. Images were obtained using confocal microscope and represent a single focal plane. Bar, 8 mum. Because cholesterol is thought to associate with sphingolipids in membranes, we analyzed the localization of select glycolipids as well as sphingomyelin in Rab11-expressing cells. Monoclonal antibodies against globotriaosyl ceramide gave prominent plasma membrane staining, and this pattern was not altered upon Rab11 expression . GM2 ganglioside is found in late endosomes , and the punctate anti-GM2 staining did not overlap with that of Rab11 . In contrast, the antibody against the glycosphingolipid sulfatide revealed that in some of the Rab11-overexpressing cells, this lipid was redistributed to Rab11-positive organelles as shown in Figure A. This labeling pattern was observed in 57% of the Rab11-overexpressing cells (n = 200). The glycolipid redistribution upon Rab11 overexpression was not as marked as that of cholesterol that consistently colocalized with GFP-Rab11 in the same cells (our unpublished data). In control cells, the anti-sulfatide antibodies visualized the plasma membrane and perinuclear organelles. Some of this labeling may correspond to recycling endosomes as the anti-sulfatide staining partially colocalized with transferrin in control cells (Figure A).  Figure 7 | Effect of GFP-wtRab11 on the distribution of sulfatide, CTxB, and Pyr10SM in COS-1 cells. Effect of GFP-wtRab11 on the distribution of sulfatide, CTxB, and Pyr10SM in COS-1 cells. (A) Cells overexpressing TfR (unpublished data) were labeled with Texas Red transferrin for 30 min on ice and transferrin internalized for 30 min at 37C. The cells were then permeabilized with filipin and stained with anti-sulfatide antibodies (top). GFP-wtRab11 and nonexpressing cells were permeabilized with filipin and stained with anti-sulfatide antibodies (bottom). (B) Cells overexpressing GFP-wtRab11 and nonexpressing cells were labeled with Alexa-conjugated CTxB for 1 h on ice and CTxB internalized for 2 h at 37C. (C) Cells overexpressing GFP or GFP-wtRab11 were labeled with Pyr10SM for 10 min at 37C and incubated for further 2 h at 37C in the absence of the lipid. The arrowheads indicate GFP-wtRab11 --positive organelles containing Pyr10SM. (D) Electron micrograph of GFP-Rab11 --overexpressing COS-1 cell. The anti-GFP antibodies decorate clustered tubulovesicular membranes. Images in A and B are confocal and represent a single focal plane. Images in C were obtained using wide-field microscope. Bars, 8 mum (A --C) and 200 nm (D). To visualize the distribution of GM1 ganglioside, we labeled the cells with Alexa 594-conjugated CTxB for 1 h on ice followed by 2 h internalization at 37C. This resulted in prominent perinuclear staining in control cells (Figure B), in accordance with the transport of the toxin to the Golgi . On Rab11 overexpression CTxB was largely redistributed to GFP-Rab11 --positive organelles (Figure B). To visualize sphingomyelin, cells were labeled with the fluorescent Pyr10SM for 10 min and chased for 2 h before fixation. At this time point Pyr10SM was not significantly degraded because >95% of the label was still associated with sphingomyelin. In GFP-expressing cells, the staining was visualized in the plasma membrane and in punctate perinuclear structures (Figure C), probably representing late endocytic organelles and the Golgi apparatus, analogously to the distribution of BODIPY-Sphingomyelin . In Rab11 cells, Pyr10SM was additionally distributed to more peripheral structures throughout the cell that colocalized to a large extent with Rab11 (Figure C). These results indicate that the Rab11-induced lipid redistribution is highly selective. The GFP-Rab11 --containing compartments exclude select early and late endosomal lipids while including specific sphingolipids and even distinguishing between different glycosphingolipid classes. When the ultrastructure of the Rab11-containing organelles was analyzed by electron microscopy the GFP-Rab11 --positive structures were resolved as tubulovesicular clusters of membranes (Figure D).  Late Endosomal Cholesterol Transport in Rab11-overexpressing Cells | One possible explanation for the accumulation of cholesterol in Rab11-containing compartments and the inhibition in cholesterol esterification could be that Rab11 interferes with LDL-cholesterol internalization. To test this possibility, we added DiI-LDL to living cells for 15 min and either fixed the cells directly or after a 2-h chase. The distribution of DiI was visualized in cells costained with antibodies against the lysosomal membrane protein lamp1. In GFP- and in Rab11-expressing cells, the markers were segregated at 15 min, whereas at 2 h extensive colocalization was observed, indicating transport of DiI to l
