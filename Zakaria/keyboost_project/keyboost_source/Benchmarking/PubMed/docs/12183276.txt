Prevalence of Protease and Reverse Transcriptase Drug Resistance Mutations over Time in Drug-Naive Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1-Positive Individuals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
The prevalence of mutations that confer resistance to protease inhibitors and to nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 49 blood samples from drug-naive human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected blood donors living in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, in 1998 was evaluated genotypically and phenotypically.

The new generation of drugs targeting the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) genes of the pol region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs), has revolutionized treatment of infected individuals . However, not all patients respond to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), and many develop drug resistance, one of the most serious obstacles to sustained suppression of HIV-1  The emergence of amino acid mutations associated with resistance to RTIs and PIs has been extensively characterized , and these substitutions can be classified into primary and secondary mutations. Primary mutations lead to a severalfold decrease in sensitivity to one or more antiretroviral (ARV) drugs . Secondary mutations may not result in a significant decrease in drug sensitivity but are associated with restoration of the original viral fitness in the presence of existing inhibitors . The transmission and dissemination of drug-resistant strains have major public health implications, including disrupting the efficiency of established ARV treatment for HIV-1-infected patients and of prophylaxis against both accidental exposures and perinatal HIV-1 transmission. Prevalences of primary resistance mutations for any drug observed among recent seroconverters range from 5 to 11% in Switzerland (; S. Yerly, E. Race, S. Vora, P. Rizzardi, J. P. Chave, M. Flepp, P.

Information on PI- and RTI-associated mutations in HIV-1-infected drug-naive individuals in Brazil is limited to specimens collected before 1996, when free access to HAART was established for AIDS patients by the Brazilian Ministry of Health . These specimens have shown a low prevalence of mutations related to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs. In this paper, we describe the genetic diversity of HIV-1 PR and RT sequences and the prevalence of mutations linked to PI and RTI resistance in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected blood donors living in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1998. Of the 18,667 blood units collected from January through December 1998 at blood banks distributed throughout the state of Rio de Janeiro, 56 were rejected based on their HIV-1 positivity by enzyme immunoassay (Prism HIV-1/HIV-2 [Abbott, North Chicago, Ill.] and Vironostika HIV Uni-Form plus O [Organon Teknika BV, Boxtel, The Netherlands]). After confirmation by Western blot analysis, the viral RNA was isolated from plasma, and PR and RT genes were RT-PCR amplified and sequenced as previously described . This study was approved by the Brazilian Ethics Committee (CONEP) as an anonymous unlinked study. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method as previously described . Of 44 samples positive for both PR and RT sequences, 40 had concordant subtype assignments in these regions, including 39 (89%) subtype-B specimens and 1 (2%) subtype-C specimen . The remaining four samples revealed discordant subtypes for the PR and RT regions, which may represent recombinant viruses. Finally, of the five specimens with HIV-1 subtype assignment for only one viral region, two PR and two RT sequences were of subtype B and one RT sequence was of subtype F. These results indicate that subtype distributions in our sampling reflect the proportions previously observed in Brazil . TABLE 1 | Presence of PR and RT inhibitor-associated mutations in subtype-B and non-B Brazilian HIV-1 strains collected in 1998 To examine the frequency of primary (D30N, M46I, G48V, I50V, V82A, -F, or T [V82A/F/T], I84V, and L90 M) and secondary (L10I/R/V, K20M/R, L24I, V32I, L33F, M36I, M46I/L, I47V, I54L/M/V, L63P, A71V/T, G73S, V77I, V82I, and N88D) PI-associated substitutions within the PR region, we analyzed these 20 amino acid sites, which are associated in vivo with resistance in HIV-1 subtype B to PIs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . This analysis revealed a lack of primary substitutions in 46 PR sequences. However, secondary mutations were found in 39 (85%) of the 46 viral sequences at six positions. L63P was the most common secondary substitution (54%; 25 of 46), followed by V77I (26%; 12 of 46), M36I (20%; 9 of 46), A71V/T (15%; 7 of 46), V82I (6%; 3 of 46), and L10I/V (4%; 2 of 46). Single amino acid mutations were identified in 23 (50%) of the 46 PR sequences, whereas 34% of sequences harbored dual (30%; 14 of 46), triple (2%; 1 of 46) and quadruple (2%) PI-associated substitutions . To search for changes over time in the PI-associated mutations among the subtype-B infections in Brazil, PI-associated substitutions found in 41 PR sequences collected in 1998 were compared with those found in 38 sequences collected from drug-naive individuals in 1987 to 1994  . There were no primary PI-associated mutations in PR sequences in either collection, and PI secondary mutational patterns were similar in the two sets. However, the frequency of isolates harboring PI-associated secondary resistance mutations was higher (0.025 < P < 0.05 by a one-tailed chi2 test) in the 1998 data set (85%) than in the 1987-to-1994 collection (66%). This finding possibly reflects a natural evolution of the PR gene over time rather than selection of HIV-1 strains harboring PI-associated substitutions resulting from PI treatment in Brazil. FIG. 1. | Percentages of PR subtype-B sequences with PI-associated secondary amino acid mutations at two different time points. Percentages of PR subtype-B sequences with PI-associated secondary amino acid mutations at two different time points. The number of sequences with the indicated mutation is given inside or directly above each bar. Statistical significances of the differences (by a one-tailed Fisher or chi2 test) are given above the bars. Total*, total numbers of sequences with at least one mutation. The results presented in Table  indicated that none of the 47 RT sequences from the 1998 collection harbored primary mutations associated with resistance to FDA-approved NRTIs  and only one had the secondary mutation V118I (2%; 1 of 47). Analysis of FDA-approved NNRTI-associated mutations indicated that neither primary nor secondary substitutions  were present in 47 RT sequences analyzed. Our findings are in agreement with the low proportion of drug-naive subjects infected with viruses harboring primary drug-resistant mutations in Venezuela and Argentina  but in contrast with reports of the presence of HIV-1 strains carrying primary mutations in drug-naive individuals in North America [, , , , ; Little et al., Antivir. Ther. 6(Suppl. 1):21, 2001] and Europe (, , , , ; Chaix et al., Program Abstr. 8th Conf. Retroviruses Opportunistic Infections, abstr. 755, 2001; Yerly et al., Program Abstr. 8th Conf. Retroviruses Opportunistic Infections, abstr. 754, 2001) who are infected with subtype-B viruses. A few factors may contribute to these differences, such as the length of time under drug selective pressures and the time period between primary infection and sampling. In addition to specific mutations known to contribute to RTI resistance, a few unusual changes were observed in RT sequences at both the NRTI resistance-associated sites (E44G [6.4%], K70I [2.2%], V75L [2.2%], Q151K [2.2%], T215P/S [8.5%], and K219P/R/T [8.5%]) and the NNRTI resistance-associated positions (A98S [4.2%] and V106/I/L [13%]) . Of note, recent data indicate that the T215S substitution, which was found in two of our RT sequences, is responsible for a more-rapid emergence of zidovudine (AZT) resistance in vitro, and it is speculated that this selection could also take place in vivo (J. G. Garcia-Lerma, S. Nidtha, K. Blumoff, H. Weinstock, and W. Heneine, Program Abstr. 5th Int. Workshop HIV Drug Resistance Treatment Strategies, abstr. 21 and 22, 2001). Sixteen isolates that represented distinct phylogenetic subtypes and a variety of genotypic PI- and RTI-associated mutation patterns were selected for in vitro evaluation of susceptibility to the PIs (saquinavir [SQV], ritonavir [RTV], indinavir [IDV], nelfinavir [NFV], and amprenavir [APV]), NRTIs (AZT, lamivudine [3TC], didanosine [ddI], zalcitibine [ddC], stavudine [d4T], and abacavir [ABV]), and NNRTIs (nevirapine [NVP], delavirdine [DLV], and efavirenz [EFV]) by using VIRCO's Antivirogram assay . This phenotypic analysis revealed moderate resistance to NFV in only one strain (98BRVM15), which harbored quadruple PI-associated secondary mutations: 36I 63P 71V 77I. Three strains (98BRVM15, 98BRVM16, and 98BRVM85) revealed moderate resistance (4.0- to 6.5-fold) to ddI. Finally, strain 98BRVM58 showed levels of resistance above the biological cutoff value for NVP (8.0-fold) . The levels of resistance above cutoff values for ddI and NVP observed in these samples could not be easily explained by the respective viral genotypes, which lacked primary resistance mutations. It is likely that mutations L283I, Y318F, and P236L (codons that were outside the RT fragment analyzed in this study), in combination with other, as yet unidentified NNRTI mutations, are responsible for moderate resistance. For example, the dual mutations I135T L283I were recently found to be associated with intermediate resistance to NVP and DLV . Our study showed that isolate 98BMVM58, which has shown resistance to NVP, had the I135T substitution. Also, it is possible that the presence of leucine instead of valine at codon 106 could contribute to the NVP resistance of this strain . Observed discrepancies between genotype and phenotype, especially with regard to intermediate resistance to NNRTIs, have been reported previously . TABLE 2 | Phenotypic and genotypic profiles of selected samples This study provides the most comprehensive evaluation to date of both the genetic diversity and the PR and RT drug-resistant patterns in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected individuals after the introduction of free access to HAART in Brazil in 1996. Our findings showing a lack of resistant strains circulating in drug-naive subjects do not support the need for genotyping before ARV therapy initiation.
