Distinct Chromosome Segregation Roles for Spindle Checkpoint Proteins
The spindle checkpoint plays a central role in the fidelity of chromosome transmission by ensuring that anaphase is initiated only after kinetochore-microtubule associations of all sister chromatid pairs are complete. In this study, we find that known spindle checkpoint proteins do not contribute equally to chromosome segregation fidelity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Loss of Bub1 or Bub3 protein elicits the largest effect. Analysis of Bub1p reveals the presence of two molecular functions. An N-terminal 608-amino acid (nonkinase) portion of the protein supports robust checkpoint activity, and, as expected, contributes to chromosome segregation. A C-terminal kinase-encoding segment independently contributes to chromosome segregation through an unknown mechanism. Both molecular functions depend on association with Bub3p. A 156-amino acid fragment of Bub1p functions in Bub3p binding and in kinetochore localization by one-hybrid assay. An adjacent segment is required for Mad1p binding, detected by deletion analysis and coimmunoprecipitation. Finally, overexpression of wild-type BUB1 or MAD3 genes leads to chromosome instability. Analysis of this activity indicates that the Bub3p-binding domain of Bub1p contributes to this phenotype through disruption of checkpoint activity as well as through introduction of kinetochore or spindle damage.

Protein components of the spindle checkpoint were first defined genetically through studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by analysis of mutants that lack the ability to arrest in the presence of spindle damage introduced by antimicrotubule drug exposure or by manipulation of temperature conditional spindle proteins . The spindle checkpoint thus defined has been shown to control at least two functionally distinct steps within mitosis. First, at metaphase, the checkpoint acts to detect a lack of bipolar attachment or tension for any sister chromatid pair. This condition delays anaphase in the presence of even a single unattached kinetochore or a lack of tension on a single chromatid pair . Second, entry into G1 (mitotic exit) is prevented in cells that have suffered spindle damage sufficient to preclude the delivery of a daughter nucleus into the bud (for review, see ; ). Metaphase arrest due to activation of the spindle checkpoint depends upon a well-conserved pathway that regulates the degradation of the anaphase inhibitor protein Securin (budding yeast Pds1p; for review, see ; ). Anaphase is normally initiated as Separin (Esp1p) is liberated from its binding partner Securin (Pds1p) after Securin is targeted for degradation by the Cdc20-associated form of the anaphase promoting complex. Cdc20p is a target of the metaphase checkpoint arrest pathway and physically interacts with other checkpoint proteins during metaphase arrest (for review, see ; ; ). Maintenance of the arrest induced by kinetochore damage also requires arrest of the mitotic exit pathway , indicating a functional connection between the distinct control pathways that operate at anaphase initiation and mitotic exit. In budding yeast, both of these steps are inhibited by the presence of Pds1 protein , and thus anaphase and exit control may be related to one another by a key role played by Pds1p or Esp1p at both cell cycle positions . Initiation of metaphase arrest in response to a lack of bipolar attachment requires at least six proteins in S. cerevisiae: Mad1p, Mad2p, Mad3p, Bub1p, Bub3p, and Mps1p . These proteins function together in kinetochore surveillance, activating a checkpoint-governed arrest in response to microtubule defects, kinetochore protein defects, or centromere DNA mutations . The proteins involved in kinetochore surveillance are remarkably conserved in eukaryotes, and homologs have been found in fission yeast, flies, maize, frog, mouse, and human (for review, see ). In systems with robust cytology, homologus of Mad1p, Mad2p, Bub1p, Bub3p, and Mps1p have been observed to concentrate at unattached kinetochores in prometaphase. Thus, these proteins behave as expected components of a molecular structure that broadcasts an inhibitory signal that will be extinguished upon achievement of bipolar attachment and/or associated tension from spindle forces exerted in opposite directions (for review, see ; ; ). Physical association studies have shown that the metaphase arrest proteins reside in several complexes that contain overlapping components, and that these complexes exhibit alterations in a cell cycle-regulated manner. In budding yeast, Mad1p/Mad2p, Bub1p/Bub3p, and Mad3p/Bub3p complexes are detected in interphase, whereas cells in damage-induced metaphase arrest contain a Bub1p/Bub3p/Mad1p complex, as well as a Cdc20p/Mad2p/Mad3p/Bub3p complex . Moreover, at metaphase arrest, both Bub1p and Mad1p exhibit shifts in gel migration consistent with hyperphosphorylated states . Movement of constituents among protein complexes may represent the spatial communication from an activated (unattached) kinetochore to site(s) where the Cdc20-associated form of the anaphase promoting complex is poised to initiate the degradation of Pds1p. Although biochemical characterization of protein complexes has provided insight into features of checkpoint activation, the nature of the spatial regulation imposed at metaphase by the presence of unattached kinetochores has not been precisely elucidated. Indeed, it is possible that different kinetochore states, such as kinetochore-microtubule attachment or the presence of tension, may be handled at metaphase by either overlapping or distinct signaling pathways . Chromosome missegregation associated with loss of kinetochore surveillance by the spindle checkpoint has been observed. In budding yeast,  observed an increase in chromosome missegregation in mad1, mad2, and mad3 mutants upon recovery from aberrant mitoses induced by exposure to the antimicrotubule drug nocodazole. In the absence of intentional spindle damage, chromosome missegregation has been detected in budding yeast bub1 and mad2 mutants  as well as in Drosophila melanogaster bub1 , Schizosaccharomyces pombe Deltabub1 , and Caenorhabditis elegans mdf-1 and mdf-2 mutants . The chromosome missegregation phenotypes observed suggest that the spindle checkpoint plays a role in many cell cycles (even in the absence of induced damage), or that Bub1 and Mad2 checkpoint proteins have additional roles in kinetochore function. In this report, we present a quantitative survey of the segregation roles of five nonessential metaphase checkpoint proteins that govern kinetochore surveillance (Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, Bub1, and Bub3) in cells without additional spindle damage. We find that these spindle checkpoint proteins differ in their contributions, and that the absence of Bub1p or Bub3p has the greatest impact on segregation. Further analysis of the role of Bub1p leads to a model in which Bub1 protein provides chromosome stability through two separate mechanisms.
Yeast Media | All yeast media are as described in .  Yeast Strains | Strains used in this study are listed in Table . Except where noted, experiments were conducted in an S288c laboratory background and are related by DNA-mediated transformation or isogenic mating and sporulation. Figure B, C, and E show data for strains that are derivatives of W303-1a. The one-hybrid assay was carried out in YJL128  and transformants derived from it.  Table 1 | Yeast strains used in this study Figure 1 | Spindle checkpoint mutants exhibit different rates of chromosome loss. Spindle checkpoint mutants exhibit different rates of chromosome loss. (A) Null mutant sectoring phenotypes. The strains shown are wild type (YPH278), bub1Delta (YFP2), bub3Delta (YFS1100), mad1Delta (YFS1120), mad2Delta (YCD173), and mad3Delta (YFS1205). (B) Chromosome loss rates in null mutants determined by half-sector analysis. Wild type: 49 half-sectored colonies/61,276 total colonies (YPH278); 8/9,305 (YKH231). bub1Delta: 192/4,784 (YFP2); 89/2,121 (YRJ112). bub2Delta: 17/22,101 (YCD165); 3/3,440 (YRJ113). bub3Delta: 137/3,362 (YFS1100); 63/2,237 (YRJ114). mad1Delta: 139/12,394 (YFS1120); 32/8,552 (YMB111). mad2Delta: 87/10,153 (YCD173); 9/3,106 (YMB113). mad3Delta: 57/29,364 (YFS1205); 29/13,186 (YRJ111). (C) Immunoblots showing overexpression from a MET25 promoter. Extracts were taken after 2 h of inductionin media lacking methionine and were analyzed by Western blot using antibody specific for each protein. The left lane (vector, p423MET) shows the endogenous Bub1p expression level where detected; the right lane ( --MET) shows protein expressed from the MET25 promoter. All strains were generated from YKH231 by introduction of p423MET-derived plasmids containing full-length open reading frames cloned adjacent to the MET25 promoter. (D) Chromosome loss associated with overexpression of checkpoint genes. Half-sector analysis was performed after plating the strains in C on plates lacking methionine. Vector: 14/19,030. METpBUB1: 195/17,640. METpBUB3: 17/17,875. METpMAD1: 28/11,920. METpMAD2: 92/17,065. METpMAD3: 137/12,115. Two or more additional independent transformants tested for each construct showed the same chromosome instability phenotype by colony sectoring assay. (E) Benomyl sensitivity of checkpoint null mutants. Log phase cultures were spotted in a 10-fold dilution series on rich medium (YPD) or rich medium plus Benomyl. Strains were mad1Delta (YMB111), mad2Delta (YMB113), mad3Delta (YRJ111), bub1Delta (YRJ112), and bub3Delta (YRJ114).  Chromosome Loss Rate | This assay was performed as previously described . Strains containing a nonessential SUP11-marked test chromosome and plasmids were grown in selective media and were plated at a density of similar200 colonies per plate on minimal (SD) medium, including 20 mug/ml uracil, 40 mug/ml l-lysine, 6 mug/ml adenine sulfate, 20 mug/ml l-histidine, 30 mug/ml l-tryptophan, and 220 mug/ml l-leucine when required to cover auxotrophies. The limiting adenine supplementation was used to facilitate red pigment development in ade2-101 cells. Chromosome loss events during the first cell division were visualized as colonies that were at least one-half red. The loss rate for the SUP11-marked chromosome is expressed as loss per chromosome per cell division, and is calculated by dividing the number of half-sectored colonies by the total number of colonies scored.  Determination of the bub1-1 Mutation | The bub1-1 allele was captured on a yeast-bacterial shuttle vector by gap repair from MAY1726 , and the entire open reading frame was sequenced from two independent transformants. The sole change observed was G to A at position 997, which substitutes a conserved glutamic acid with lysine in the putative Bub3p binding region. Therefore, bub1-1 is referred to as bub1-E333K.  Introduction of bub1 Mutations at the Genomic Locus | Plasmid-borne mutant alleles were created adjacent to a HIS3 marker, amplified in a single DNA fragment with the selectable marker by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and integrated by homologous recombination into the native BUB1 locus. The resulting genomic structure contained the native BUB1 promoter, a mutant bub1 allele, an HIS3 downstream marker gene, and finally, natural BUB1 3'-flanking sequence. Details of the constructions are available upon request.  One-Hybrid Assay | The one-hybrid assay was performed essentially as described . YJL128 was transformed with activation domain fusion constructs, and multiple independent transformants were plated on SD-LEU supplemented with 5 mM 3-amino-triazole (3-AT). Plates were incubated at 30C for up to 2 wk.  MPS1 Overexpression | A GAL-MPS1 allele  was created by integration of pAFS120 at the MPS1 locus of YFS589 yielding yeast strain YML101. BUB1 overexpression plasmids were introduced into YML101, and two independent transformants were picked. Cultures were grown overnight in selective media lacking histidine and uracil supplemented with 2% raffinose, diluted into selective media lacking histidine, uracil, and methionine (to derepress the MET25 promoter) supplemented with 2% raffinose and were grown to early log phase. To induce MPS1 overexpression, galactose was added to a final concentration of 3%. Samples taken at t = 0 and t = 4 h were fixed in1 M sorbitol, 50 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, and 3.7% formaldehyde, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stained, and scored for bud and nuclear morphology. A minimum of 200 cells was scored for each sample.  Plasmids | All overexpression constructs were made in either p423MET (2mu HIS3) or p415MET (CEN/ARS/LEU2) vectors containing the methionine-repressible MET25 promoter and the CYC1 terminator sequence flanking the multiple cloning site . For one-hybrid analysis, GAL4-AD fusions were constructed by cloning each PCR-generated open reading frame into pGADT7 (, Palo Alto, CA). All plasmids generated by PCR were verified by sequence analysis. Details are available upon request.  Immunoblotting and Coimmunoprecipitation | Immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously . The lysis buffer for coimmunoprecipitation was 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mM KCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na vanadate, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na Deoxycholate, 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfoxide, "complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail" (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Rabbit alpha-Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, Bub1, and Bub3 antibodies have been previously described .
Spindle Checkpoint Mutants Exhibit Different Rates of Chromosome Loss | In previous work, it was apparent that chromosome loss of bub1 and mad2 mutants differed from one another . To determine the requirement for spindle checkpoint proteins in accurate chromosome segregation during normal unperturbed mitosis, null mutants of six checkpoint genes (BUB1, BUB2, BUB3, MAD1, MAD2, and MAD3) were generated in an otherwise isogenic background. To follow chromosome segregation fidelity, the loss of a nonessential test chromosome  was ascertained by a colony color assay . In this assay, haploid colonies containing the test chromosome bearing a SUP11 (ochre-suppressing tRNA) gene are white, whereas cells that have lost the test chromosome accumulate a red pigment due to the host ade2-101 (ochre) mutation. Thus, loss events give rise to red sectors during colony growth. The checkpoint mutant strains were plated on color indicator plates and chromosome loss rates were evaluated visually by colony sectoring morphology and by half-sector analysis . In half-sector analysis, the rate of first division missegregation events is directly measured by observing the number of colonies that are at least one-half red, and dividing by the total number of colonies that were established by cells with a test chromosome. In an S288c background, bub1Delta and bub3Delta cells exhibited the highest rates of chromosome loss, 50-fold higher than the wild-type rate of 0.8 loss events per 1000 divisions (Figure , A and B). mad1Delta and mad2Delta strains also showed an increased chromosome loss rate, but at a level two- to threefold lower than bub1Delta and bub3Delta. mad3Delta exhibited a slight increase above wild type, whereas bub2Delta was indistinguishable from control. To test the generality of this result, the null mutants were characterized in a different laboratory strain background, W303-1a. The strong phenotypes for bub1Delta and bub3Delta were again observed, but the smaller differences among the mad null mutants were less apparent in W303-1a strains. At a minimum, the chromosome loss phenotypes indicate that Bub1 and Bub3 proteins have an additional role that is important to chromosome segregation during culture in the absence of intentional spindle damage. Kinetochore surveillance checkpoint proteins perform their functions in the context of multiprotein complexes. To test whether cells are sensitive to protein dosage, each full-length open reading frame was placed under the control of the MET25 promoter (MET25p), whose transcriptional strength is controlled by altering the environmental methionine concentration . MET25p-controlled expression of the five checkpoint proteins led to steady-state protein levels in excess of wild type (Figure C). The MET25p-controlled alleles were introduced into a wild-type yeast strain containing the test chromosome for monitoring chromosome segregation. Cultures grown in the presence of methionine were diluted in water and plated at similar200 cells/plate on media lacking methionine. Half-sector analysis indicated that overexpression of Bub1p and Mad3p led to a 15-fold increase in test chromosome missegregation over the wild-type rate (0.7 loss events per 1000 divisions; Figure D). High-level expression of Mad1p and Mad2p caused a smaller increase in chromosome missegregation (three- and sevenfold), whereas high level expression of Bub3p had no effect. Commonly used assays for the presence of checkpoint deficiency measure cell survival in the presence of antimicrotubule drugs such as Benomyl. The Benomyl sensitivity elicited by the absence of each kinetochore surveillance checkpoint protein was determined using the panel of null alleles. Strain viability was tested in the presence of a concentration of drug that delays but does not arrest wild-type cell growth. Cells containing bub1 and bub3 mutations were more Benomyl sensitive than mad1, mad2, or mad3 mutants by an order of magnitude (Figure E). Thus, checkpoint proteins differ in their contribution to the maintenance of cell viability in response to mild spindle damage. Note that the order of Benomyl sensitivity correlates with the relative intrinsic chromosome loss rates observed (Figure A). In principle, Benomyl sensitivity of mutants in this assay may reflect a sum of defective mechanisms contributing to cell death, including drug-induced hindrance of microtubule dynamics, null mutant kinetochore structural defects, and inappropriate cell cycle progression.  BUB1 and BUB3 Cooperate in a Chromosome Segregation Role | To determine whether the overexpression phenotype of Bub1 was due to discrete domain(s), a series of BUB1 truncation alleles was constructed capable of expressing the N-terminal 210, 367, or 608 amino acids as well as amino acid segments 211-1021 and 211 --367 (Figure A). Western analysis using a Bub1p-specific antibody raised to the N-terminal 216 amino acids indicated that MET25-promoted expression led to significant protein accumulation in cells grown in the absence of methionine (Figure B). A serial dilution analysis indicated that the full-length overexpression product reached similar50-fold that of wild type.  Figure 2 | The N terminus of Bub1p contributes to the overexpression phenotype and is counterbalanced by additional BUB3. The N terminus of Bub1p contributes to the overexpression phenotype and is counterbalanced by additional BUB3. (A) Diagram of BUB1 protein and protein fragments. The boxes indicate positions of conserved regions of BUB1p. Black: Mad3 like. White: Bub3 binding. Hatched: kinase domain. Star: E333K mutation. (B) Western blot detection of BUB1 overexpression alleles. Left: Wild-type cells (YPH278) containing MET25-promoted Bub1 alleles in p423MET were grown in the absence of methionine. Western blot analysis using an antibody raised to the N-terminal 216 amino acids of Bub1p  detects protein bands with migrations consistent with eachconstruct, in addition to faster migrating degradation products. Endogenous Bub1p is not detected at this exposure (vector lane). Right: A dilution series Western blot indicates that the overexpression level for full-length BUB1 is similar50-fold. (C) Chromosome missegregation induced by BUB1 overexpression alleles. Left: Full-length and partial BUB1 alleles expressed from the MET25 promoter of p423MET were introduced into a wild-type strain (YPH278). Chromosome loss was determined by half-sector analysis after plating to methionine-free medium. Vector (no insert) and pBUB1 data are from D. p[1-210]: 25/14,087. p[1-367]: 127/5,741. p[1-608]: 96/6,592. p[211-1021]: 157/10,697. p[211-367]: 247/13,781. p[211-367*]: 9/5,117. Right: Chromosome loss was determined in YPH278 containing plasmid pairs as shown. p423MET + p415MET: 1/2,616. p423MET + pBUB3: 7/4,998. p[211-367] + p415MET: 37/3,015. p[211-367] + pBUB3: 6/4,510. At least two additional independent transformants of each construct were tested by visual sectoring assay and showed the same chromosome instability phenotype. (D) Chromosome loss in bub1 and bub3 null mutants. Left: Half sector analysis was used to compare chromosome loss rates of bub1Delta, bub3Delta, and bub1Delta bub3Delta mutant strains derived from sporulation of a wild-type diploid (YCD251) into which heterozygous bub1Delta::natMX and bub3Delta::kanMX alleles were introduced by transformation. bub1Delta: 186/5019 (one spore); bub3Delta: 262/5406 (one spore); bub1Delta bub3Delta: 601/12566 (four spores). Right: Chromosome missegration in a bub3Delta strain (YFS1100) containing the vector p423MET (284/5,675) or overexpression plasmid p[211-367] (289/6,069). Each of the truncation constructs was introduced into wild-type cells on high-methionine medium, where expression is suppressed. Chromosome loss was quantitated for several independent transformants by half-sector analysis after plating on low-methionine medium (Figure C, left). Under these conditions, the full-length construct exhibits a 15-fold increase in loss (from Figure D). Overexpression of the N-terminal 367 or 608 amino acids of Bub1p from plasmids (p[1 --367] and p[1 --608], respectively) caused a 30- and 20-fold increase in chromosome loss. Overexpression of the N-terminal 210 amino acids had little effect (2.4-fold, Figure C). The segment common to p[1 --367] and p[1 --608], but absent from p[1 --210], contains a well-conserved homology box predicted to mediate association between Bub1p and Bub3p . This result suggested that overexpression of a Bub3-binding region of Bub1p might cause the chromosome loss. To test this hypothesis, a construct expressing only amino acids 211 --367 under the control of the MET25 promoter was created. It too was found to induce chromosome loss at high expression levels (26-fold greater than the vector control). Several additional lines of in vivo evidence now strongly support the interpretation that the overexpression phenotype is mediated through disruption of a Bub1p/Bub3p interaction. First, the bub1-1 point mutation , which is suppressed by a low-level increase in BUB3 gene dosage, was cloned and identified as E333K (see "Materials and Methods"). This mutation is located within the 211 --367 segment. Second, when the E333K mutation was introduced into the p[211 --367] plasmid, this allele failed to induce chromosome instability (Figure C, left panel). Third, expression of additional BUB3 from a MET25-controlled allele (from plasmid pBUB3) on a centromere vector (p415MET) reversed the chromosome instability phenotype of p[211 --367] (Figure C, right). Fourth, a BUB1/BUB3 cooperative role in chromosome segregation implied by this interpretation was tested by analyzing the chromosome loss rate of a bub1Delta bub3Delta mutant (Figure D, left). The rate observed in the double mutant (48 events in 1000 divisions) is consistent with a shared role for Bub1p and Bub3p. Finally, if the presence of excessive bub1[211 --367]p interferes with a Bub1p-Bub3p association, then this protein fragment should not elicit additional missegregation in the absence of the complex. Indeed, its overexpression does not augment chromosome loss in a bub3Delta null mutant (Figure D, right). We conclude that an interaction between Bub1 and Bub3 proteins is likely to be mediated by amino acids 211 --367 of Bub1p in vivo, and disruption of this interaction contributes significantly to the overexpression phenotype associated with excessive Bub1p.  Yeast Bub1p Can Associate with Kinetochores in a One-Hybrid Assay | Previous experiments have demonstrated kinetochore localization of Bub1 protein in experimental systems where these structures are cytologically visible . To date, localization of checkpoint proteins to budding yeast kinetochore structures has not been achieved. In a one-hybrid assay , kinetochore protein components can activate a HIS3 reporter gene located immediately adjacent to the centromere of chromosome III. This reporter system depends on the presence of an active centromere, reveals association of known kinetochore components, and has been successfully used to identify new kinetochore proteins . We used this assay to ask whether kinetochore association of full-length Bub1p or truncation alleles can be detected in budding yeast. Independent transformants containing Gal4-activation domain fusions of Bub1 and Bub1 fragments were spotted onto minimal medium lacking leucine and histidine supplemented with 5 mM 3-AT. Figure  shows that fusions of BUB1[1 --367], BUB1[1 --608], and BUB1[211 --367] can activate transcription of the centromere reporter, indicating that these proteins can localize to kinetochores. Reporter activation with the full-length BUB1 fusion protein is not observed, likely due to a lower level of fusion protein accumulation or the presence of a nonfunctional conformation.  Figure 3 | Localization of activation domain fusions to kinetochores in a one-hybrid assay. Localization of activation domain fusions to kinetochores in a one-hybrid assay. In the one-hybrid assay, fusion of the GAL4-activation domain to a kinetochore-binding protein induces transcription of a centromere-adjacent HIS3 reporter allele . GAL4AD fusion constructs were introduced into strain YJL128. The fusion moiety is indicated to the right; GAL4AD-CTF13 (top) served as a positive control. Four independent transformants were grown to saturation in SD-LEU, diluted to 1.5 x 107 cells/ml, and spotted (3 mul) on SD-HIS, LEU + 5 mM 3-AT. The spots shown were incubated at 30C for 14 d. The large papillae that appear occasionally in the GAL4AD-BUB1 transformants (observed in similar25% of transformants) may reflect the occurrence of truncating mutations. All constructs were similarly tested in YJL148, a strain containing a mutant centromere sequence adjacent to the HIS3 reporter . No growth above vector background was observed in these controls. All fusion constructs shown were functional in a two-hybrid assay. Activation domain fusions of other kinetochore surveillance proteins were also tested. MAD1 and MAD3 fusions activated the reporter , whereas BUB3 and MAD2 fusions did not. CTF13-AD is shown as a control: it activates the HIS3 reporter and supports growth on 3-AT within 3 --4 d at 30C, whereas the checkpoint fusion proteins tested require up to 14 d to show evidence of activation over vector background. This weak signal is consistent with a transient association, as would be expected for proteins that associate with a subset of kinetochores for a subset of the cell cycle. An unequal transcriptional activation efficiency for different fusion proteins may also be a contributing factor. We conclude from these experiments that the budding yeast kinetochore surveillance proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad3 can associate with yeast kinetochores, as is predicted from localizations of their studied orthologs.  The BUB1 Overexpression Phenotype Includes Disruption of Both Checkpoint and Segregation Functions | High-level expression of Bub1p (and fragments of this protein) may disrupt kinetochore checkpoint signaling, a segregation function, or both. To address whether checkpoint signaling was disrupted, strains overexpressing full-length Bub1p or protein fragments were tested for checkpoint competence in two different assays. The first took advantage of the spindle checkpoint-dependent delay exhibited by ctf18Delta cells, which is associated with a partial defect in sister chromatid cohesion . This delay is detected as an accumulation of G2/M phase cells during early log phase using flow cytometry (Figure A, left column). MET25-controlled alleles were introduced into ctf18Delta cells and transformants were selected on high-methionine medium. Four independent transformants were then grown in medium without methionine for 18 --24 h (O.D. similar0.4) and were analyzed for DNA content using flow cytometry (Figure A). Diminution of the G2/M phase peak indicated that the delay can be disrupted by overexpression of full-length Bub1p, Bub1[1 --367]p, Bub1[1 --608]p, and Bub1p[211 --367]p. The G2/M reduction is consistent with an observed decrease in the proportion of budded cells (Figure A), as well as a reduction in viability determined by growth on solid medium with or without methionine (Figure B). The degree of delay diminution and reduced viability correlates with the amount of chromosome loss induced by the overexpression alleles (see Figure B). We observed similar loss of delay and viability in cells lacking CTF19 (C.D. Warren, unpublished data), a gene that encodes a nonessential kinetochore protein . We conclude from these experiments that overexpression of Bub1p, and Bub1p fragments that cause chromosome loss, does have the capacity to disrupt a spindle checkpoint-dependent delay.  Figure 4 | Overexpression of Bub1p or Bub1p fragments both disrupts the spindle checkpoint and causes damage. Overexpression of Bub1p or Bub1p fragments both disrupts the spindle checkpoint and causes damage. (A) Disruption of a ctf18Delta-induced checkpoint delay. ctf18Delta strains containing p423MET plasmids expressing no (vector), full-length (BUB1), or partial (1 --210, 1 --367, 211 --367, 1 --608) alleles of BUB1 were created by transformation of YFS377. Cells were grown to early log phase in the absence of methionine for 18 --24 h, and were prepared for flow cytometry (as in ). A representative histogram is given for each genotype; four independent transformants were analyzed. The fractions of budded and unbudded cells were determined and are shown as mean +- SD (3 d.f.). (B) Disruption of the ctf18Delta delay results in decreased viability. Two independent isolates from each of the ctf18Delta strains described in A were grown to early log phase in media containing methionine. Cells were spotted onto solid medium without methionine in a 10-fold serial dilution series. Overexpression of bub1-[211-367]p in wild-type or bub3Delta cells did not result in a significant reduction in mortality (bottom). (C) Competence to arrest in response to MPS1 overexpression. Log phase cells grown in raffinose media lacking methionine (to induce expression of the BUB1 alleles) were treated with 3% galactose to induce MPS1 expression. Samples were taken at t = 0 and t = 4 h, formaldehyde fixed, DAPI stained, and scored for bud and nuclear morphology. The graph shows the percentage arrested (large-budded uninucleate) cells at each time point. Two independent transformants were analyzed (average +- range indicated). All strains were derived from YML101 (GAL-MPS1). All plasmids overexpressing BUB1 alleles in this strain were derived from p423MET (vector). YCD362 (bub1Delta) was included as a control for the assay. (D) Chromosome missegregation in a mad3Delta host. Chromosome loss rates were determined by half-sector analysis on plates lacking methionine. Vector: 5/3,327. pBUB1: 18/2,295. p[1 --210]: 4/2,408. p[1 --367]: 51/2,500. p[1 --608]: 42/2,766. p[211 --367]: 37/2,349. Data for a representative transformant are shown; at least two independent transformants were analyzed for each construct. The strains were YFS1205 derivatives created by introduction of p423MET (vector) and related BUB1 allele overexpression plasmids. In a second system, we obtained evidence that the checkpoint arrest pathway is not completely dysfunctional. In this experiment, checkpoint activation by overexpression of the MPS1 protein kinase was used to cause cell cycle arrest . MPS1-induced arrest is dependent on each of the known BUB and MAD checkpoint genes . If overexpression of Bub1p or Bub1p fragments completely disrupts the checkpoint pathway, similar to a null mutant, then MPS1 overexpression will not cause cell cycle arrest. Wild-type strains containing integrated GAL1-MPS1 as well as MET-controlled BUB1 overexpression plasmids were grown in medium lacking methionine to induce high-level expression of the BUB1 truncation alleles. Samples were taken before and 4 h after addition of galactose (for overexpression of MPS1). Formaldehyde-fixed cells were stained with DAPI and were scored for morphological evidence of metaphase arrest. Strains overexpressing the full-length Bub1p, Bub1[1 --367]p, or Bub1
